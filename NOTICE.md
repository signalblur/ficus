# Attributions

Everything in this repository that did not originate with the Ficus fork. The
software licence itself is [LICENSE](LICENSE) (MIT); this file is the inventory
that licence refers to.

## Software

**[claude-carbon](https://github.com/gwittebolle/claude-carbon)**, copyright
Gaëtan Wittebolle, MIT. Ficus is a fork pinned at commit
`43fb883ac1989d962c8699afb0be37fbe69c4476` (tag `upstream-43fb883`). The
transcript parser, the backfill, the SQLite ledger of raw tokens, the
Jegham-derived emission factors, the price tracking and the golden-vector test
suite come from it. `MAINTENANCE.md` records which files stay byte-close to
upstream and why.

`docs/data-flow.png` is also upstream, added in commit `8ddd000`, and carries
the same MIT copyright.

No third-party code is vendored, no dependency is bundled, and the dashboard
ships no webfont. The type stack is system fonts only.

## Photographs

Seven photographs are stored base64-inline in `data/giving-shortlist.json`, one
per organisation, and rendered into the dashboard. Each is a work of the United
States federal government and is therefore in the public domain under
[17 U.S.C. § 105](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#105). No
licence grant is required and none is claimed; the credit is recorded because
the provenance should be checkable, not because copyright compels it.

`scripts/generate-dashboard.sh` refuses to build if any image is missing alt
text or any field of that credit block, and the dashboard prints the whole table
in its colophon. Adding an eighth image means adding an eighth row here.

`docs/dashboard.png` is a headless render of the fabricated demo page produced
by `scripts/build-demo.sh`, so it inherits the credits above.

## Data and research

The numeric constants are not copyrightable facts, but they belong to the people
who measured them, and each carries a `_source` field naming the publication and
the date it was recorded:

- Emission factors: Jegham et al. 2025, [arXiv:2505.09598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09598).
- Cross-check model and constants: [EcoLogits](https://ecologits.ai) (GenAI Impact), JOSS DOI 10.21105/joss.07471.
- Embodied-carbon inputs: BoaviztAPI, and Lees-Perasso et al. on the H100.
- Equivalence figures: US EIA, US EPA WaterSense, and the EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator, each quoted verbatim in `data/equivalence-constants.json`.

`METHODOLOGY.md` carries the derivations. `data/giving-shortlist.json` records
which research document each sentence about an organisation came from.
