# carbon-review.sh — the /carbon-review report: every lifetime figure rendered
# as markdown for the agent context window, each translated into a familiar
# scale using data/equivalence-constants.json (published figures with citations;
# the formulas live in that file and are computed HERE, never by the model),
# plus a plain-language explainer of what each metric means and where it comes
# from. Output is deterministic: same DB, byte-identical markdown.
#
# CARBON_LEDGER_EQUIV overrides the equivalence-constants path (tests). If the
# file is missing the familiar-scale column is omitted and its absence stated —
# a public checkout must degrade, not invent numbers.
