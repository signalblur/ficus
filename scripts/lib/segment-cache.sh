#
# Atomically rewrites <state>/segment-cache with the pre-formatted all-time
# statusline segment, three lines:
#   1: "∑ ⚡ <kWh> 💧 <L> 💨 <tonnes>"  — all-time readings
#   2: "<owed>/<overall>"  — USD still owed over the overall cost of everything
#      emitted at the removal rate from data/offset-constants.json. Owed nets
#      out verified-removal tonnes AND recorded donation dollars (1:1, the
#      user's short-term accounting), clamped at 0; the gap between the pair is
#      what has been contributed
#   3: "💨 <paid>t/<emitted>t" — verified removal purchased vs total emitted,
#      rendered on the totals line beneath the separator
# The statusline render path only ever reads this file; all DB work happens
# here, at write time (Stop hook, backfill, recompute, offset recording).
#
# Never fails the caller — persist-session.sh runs without set -e in a hook
# that must exit 0.
