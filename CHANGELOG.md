# Changelog

Entries below 1.2.0 are upstream `claude-carbon`'s, kept as they were so
cherry-picks stay clean. Fork releases are added above them.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-08-09

### A session is now split across the days it actually ran

The ledger kept one row per session with a single `started_at`, so every daily
figure charged a whole session to the day it began. Defensible while the chart
bucketed by month; not defensible once it draws days. The numbers say how much
not: on a real 1,470-session ledger only 80 sessions cross midnight — five
percent — but those 80 carry **88.7% of the carbon**, because the long sessions
are the heavy ones and the long ones are what run past midnight.

Nothing is apportioned. Every assistant message already carries its own
timestamp beside its own token usage, so the Stop hook groups those measurements
by date into a new `session_days` table. On a real midnight-crossing session that
splits 59.331 g into 53.828 g and 5.503 g — the following day had been carrying
9.3% of that session and being shown none of it. The per-day rows sum to exactly
the session row and a test asserts it; if they ever stop tying out, something has
started being modelled instead of counted.

History cannot be recovered, because a pruned transcript cannot be split. So
every reader falls back to the start day for sessions with no split, and the page
counts the ones it knows crossed midnight and says so instead of claiming an
accuracy the older half of the ledger cannot support. The previous comment
promising this distortion was "negligible at daily and coarser" was wrong and is
corrected rather than repeated.

### The x-axis is a ruler now

A minor tick per day, taller ones on the 8th, 15th, 22nd and 29th, and the month
rule continuing down through the band as the major tick. The tall marks come from
the date each row carries rather than from counting seven rows along — the first
month on record almost always starts mid-month, and stepping in sevens from
whatever day that happened to be would put the weekly marks on different dates in
the first month than in every month after it.

The count is right by construction: ticks are drawn one per row of the daily
series, and those rows come from stepping real dates, so February gets 28 — or 29
in a leap year — because February did. Both are asserted. Below 3.5px per day
only the weekly marks are kept; below 5px the month rules carry the axis alone.

### Lighter paper

The plane behind the cards moves from `#f1f3f2` to `#f7f9f8`. It also raises the
working mint's contrast against it from 3.43:1 to 3.61:1, so the SC 1.4.11
obligation on the rules got easier rather than harder.

### fix: two ways a session could vanish or a page could fail

A split session was counted on `date(started_at)`, but the hook stamps that when
it first sees a session — so a resumed or re-read session matched none of its own
days and dropped out of the session counts entirely while its carbon stayed on
the chart. It is now counted on the first day it actually spent tokens.

And `generate-dashboard.sh` did not migrate before reading. The first run after
this change against an existing ledger failed outright on a missing table instead
of rendering the history it already held.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-08-09

### The month view now draws every day

"Usage over time" grouped by month plotted one point per month, which hides what
produced it: one fourteen-hour Tuesday and a quiet fortnight land in the same bin
at the same height. The month view now draws one point per DAY and rules each
month start, so the months are the structure and the days are the data. The lane
scales to the biggest single day; the figures table underneath still totals the
months, so nothing is lost. It is a resolution swap, not a second y-scale — this
page still refuses dual scales everywhere.

Three things fell out of drawing 150 points where there were 5. Dots thin out
below 9px of spacing, keeping only the peak, because a dot per day fuses into a
ribbon that distinguishes nothing. The spoken description summarises past 40
points instead of reciting the table badly. And the year now rides the axis only
where it changes — repeating `2026-` on every tick spent the width that
separates the months on the part that never varies.

Past 1,100 days on record the view falls back to month totals, and says so
rather than dropping the detail quietly.

### fix: an all-zero lane could take the whole chart down

`vals.indexOf(max)` returns −1 when every value is zero, because `max` falls back
to 1 and 1 is not in the data. That indexed past the end of the points array. Any
ledger whose sessions all recorded zero emissions rendered a blank page.

### fix: the statusline was pricing sessions at a superseded rate

The removal price moved from $160 to $227 a tonne in
`data/offset-constants.json`. Every path that reads that file picked it up; the
statusline, which reads only the `factors.env` cache, did not — so it priced each
session thirty percent under the ledger for days. Nothing failed and no test went
red. `lib/factors-env.sh` gained `refresh_factors_env_if_stale`, called from the
Stop hook, comparing mtimes numerically rather than with `-nt` (which is false
for equal timestamps at one-second granularity, i.e. exactly the edit nobody
expects to be missed). The same drift had left the giving card quoting the
retired $160 wholesale index as a retail price; it now quotes €198 ≈ $227 with
the FX constant that converted it.

### The session cost moved to the session row, and is legible again

`▲ $0.03 session` sat in the Totals column beside the lifetime dollar pair — a
figure about the last twenty minutes inside a row about every session ever
recorded. It now rides with the ⚡/💧/💨 readings it was computed from, and the
Totals column carries only totals. Below a dollar it is shown in cents: at $227/t
a whole cent is 44 g of CO2e, so a dollars-and-cents figure read `$0.00` through
the opening stretch of every session and then jumped, which is indistinguishable
from a figure that has stopped updating.

### A documentation site, and the demo moved to make room for it

`https://signalblur.github.io/ficus/` was the demo dashboard. It is now a landing
page covering install, where the data comes from, how each figure is calculated
and what each organisation on the giving shortlist actually does; the demo lives
at `/dashboard.html` and is linked from the hero, the nav and its own section.

The page is generated by `scripts/build-docs.sh` from the same data files the
ledger computes with, so a constant cannot say one thing in the code and another
in the documentation — `tests/run-docs-tests.sh` fails the build if they drift.
Same offline invariant as the dashboard: no script, and nothing the browser would
load.

### The wordmark is a ficus

It was a bar-chart glyph, which competed with the real charts underneath it — a
mark that looks like data reads as data — and the project is named after a plant.
Drawn for 24px first: five broad leaves, two mint tones for depth, and a solid
pot as the only dark mass, so the silhouette survives greyscale and forced
colours.

### fix: a stopped container daemon was reported as a syntax error

`run-dashboard-tests.sh` parses the embedded renderer inside a container. With
the daemon down the run exits non-zero having never reached node, and the suite
called that a syntax error — sending someone to hunt a bug in the renderer that
was not there. The verdict now comes from what node actually said.

## 2026-08-03

### fix: a hook already present under a different spelling was added twice

The wiring compared hook commands as raw strings, so the same script reached `settings.json` twice whenever the two spellings differed. That is not hypothetical: the README's manual block writes `~/code/claude-carbon/scripts/persist-session.sh` while the installer writes the expanded absolute path, and Claude Code also accepts escaped spaces (`~/Claude\ OS/…`). Anyone who wired it by hand and later ran the installer ended up persisting every session twice and running the rescan twice. Commands are now compared on what they resolve to (tilde expanded, escaped spaces unescaped, directory resolved with `pwd -P`), while the entry already in the file is left spelled exactly as the user wrote it. A third-party hook whose directory does not exist is compared literally, as before.

Found by the new install tests rather than by a user, which is the point of them.

### test: the install and update wiring now has a suite

`tests/run-install-tests.sh`, 22 assertions covering cold start, an install predating a hook, a foreign status line and third-party hooks that must survive untouched, repeated runs, equivalent path spellings, the marketplace-cache guard, the repair `update.sh` performs on a local clone, and a corrupt `settings.json` that must be left alone rather than truncated. Each case runs under its own throwaway `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and nothing touches the network. Removing the spelling fix makes three of them fail, so they are not decorative.

The SessionStart bug fixed earlier today would have been caught by the first case.

### ci: shellcheck on every shell script

2421 lines of bash had no linter. Warnings and errors now gate the build, style notes stay advisory. The pass fixed a `cd` without a guard, a trap that unquoted its temp paths and would have skipped cleanup when the server had already exited, two `local x="$(…)"` masking return values, and an unquoted command substitution in the release script. Two tilde matches are deliberate and carry a justified `shellcheck disable`.

### feat: the update notice names the version

`⬆ /carbon-update` became `⬆ 1.1.3 /carbon-update`, so a patch and a minor can be told apart before deciding to interrupt what you were doing. The three fields are read in a single `jq` call rather than three, since the status line runs on every turn. A flag file written by an older version, without the field, falls back to the bare command. `update.sh` now prints the CHANGELOG URL after updating.

### chore: release script and a CI guard on the version manifests

The update notice is keyed on the version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, so shipping to `main` without bumping reaches nobody: today's SessionStart fix sat behind that exact gap. Two additions make the bump mechanical rather than remembered.

`scripts/release.sh patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z` refuses to run off main, on a dirty tree or out of sync with the remote, checks the three manifests already agree, bumps them together (plus the lockfile), re-reads them to confirm the write landed, commits, tags, pushes, and opens the GitHub release as a draft pre-filled with the CHANGELOG lines added since the last tag. It also reports whether any runtime file actually changed, so a docs-only release that would nag users for nothing is visible before it goes out. `--dry-run` prints every step and writes nothing; npm publishing stays opt-in behind `--npm` since the tarball only carries `bin/`.

Exercised for real against a throwaway local origin, not just in `--dry-run`: the bump lands on all three manifests, the commit and both pushes go through, and a failing `gh release create` no longer aborts silently under `set -e` after the tag is already pushed. It now says what is already published, that nothing is inconsistent, and prints the command plus the kept notes file to finish by hand.

`scripts/check-versions.sh` runs in CI. It fails when the three manifests disagree, which always means one of npm, the marketplace or the notice is lying. It warns, without failing, when files under `scripts/`, `hooks/`, `skills/`, `data/`, `install.sh` or `bin/` changed since the last tag while the version did not: batching commits into one release is normal, silently forgetting for six weeks is not.

### fix: SessionStart hook never wired by install.sh

`install.sh` wrote only `statusLine` and the `Stop` hook, so every curl/npx install has been missing `SessionStart` → `safety-rescan.sh` since the beginning (`git log -S SessionStart -- install.sh` is empty). Two things were silently off for those users: the throttled safety rescan that catches sessions the Stop hook missed (crash, kill, hook disabled), and the update notifier, since `check-update.sh` is launched from `safety-rescan.sh` and the status line only ever reads the flag it writes. They were never told a new version existed. Marketplace installs were unaffected, `hooks/hooks.json` declares the hook.

The settings and slash-command wiring moves out of `install.sh` into `scripts/configure-settings.sh`, called by both `install.sh` and `update.sh`, so an install predating a hook is repaired on the next `/carbon-update` instead of staying half-wired. `update.sh` previously delegated to `setup.sh` under a comment claiming it refreshed settings; `setup.sh` only ever touched the database. The merge stays additive and idempotent (third-party `SessionStart` hooks and a foreign `statusLine` are preserved), and now writes through tmp + mv: the old truncating redirect would have destroyed the user's `settings.json` if `jq` had failed mid-write.

The README's manual-install block had the same hole, so anyone wiring it by hand reproduced the bug: it now shows both hooks and says what each one does, and points at `configure-settings.sh` for people who would rather not hand-edit JSON (the manual path also never installed the `/carbon-*` commands).

## 2026-08-02

### chore: gitignore .claude/settings.local.json

Per-machine Claude Code permission file, was sitting untracked. Last gap flagged by a repo hygiene pass against the GitHub community checklist (health score 100%, everything else already in place).

### docs: MCP servers lever in Reduce your footprint

New subsection after Compact earlier: disconnecting unused MCP servers cuts the tool schemas re-sent with every request. Deliberately unquantified (no row in the Combined impact table): the overhead is mostly cache reads, whose energy factor is the methodology's widest band, so any percentage would be false precision. Mechanism plus `claude mcp list` / `claude mcp remove` only.

### docs: Related projects section in the README

Four entries before Further reading, tools rather than papers: EcoLogits, CodeCarbon, ImpactIA (link only, its CC-BY-NC-SA license keeps its data out of the factors), green-claude. ImpactIA already cites claude-carbon as an integration target, so the link closes the cross-reference.

## 2026-08-01

### feat: install-sync check in the statusline (stale plugin cache detection)

Incident behind it: on a machine running both a git clone (statusline, manual scripts) and a marketplace install (the Stop/SessionStart hooks that write carbon.db), the marketplace cache stayed at v1.0.0 while the clone moved to v1.1.1. Six weeks of sessions were persisted with pre-v6 factors, and Fable sessions fell back to the sonnet family (no fable support in 1.0.0): CO2 overstated 2.8x overall, fable costs understated 2.25x. Every check (golden vectors, fact-checks, update notice) ran green because they all looked at the current copy; auto-update is opt-in for third-party marketplaces, so the cache never moved. Fixed operationally with `claude plugin update` + `recompute.sh`.

- statusline.sh now compares its own `data/factors.json` and `data/prices.json` byte-for-byte against the newest plugin cache copy (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/claude-carbon/<latest>/`) and appends `≠ install drift` when they differ. Local-only (two `cmp` calls per render, no state file, no network), self-skips when the statusline runs from that cache copy (single-install machines never see it), ignores superseded version dirs, opt-out via `CLAUDE_CARBON_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER`-style env `CLAUDE_CARBON_NO_DRIFT_CHECK`.
- Chosen over recomputing recent db rows against current factors: subagent tokens are folded into the session row with per-model CO2 (persist-session.sh), so a math check would false-positive on cross-model subagent sessions (e.g. Haiku routing), while an install comparison has no false positives and fires the day the copies diverge.
- check-update.sh: corrected the comment claiming marketplace users get native auto-update (it is opt-in for third-party marketplaces); the notice itself still targets git-clone installs only.

### feat: monthly share nudge and post draft in /carbon-card

- statusline.sh shows `📊 /carbon-card` to the first 3 distinct sessions of each month (tunable via `CLAUDE_CARBON_CARD_NUDGE_SESSIONS`), then goes quiet until next month, so it never nags: generate-report.sh stamps the month in `last-card-month` (clears the nudge immediately) and prints a `Totals since ...` summary line. Opt-out via `CLAUDE_CARBON_NO_CARD_NUDGE`. No auto-posting anywhere: the action stays human.
- /carbon-card now offers a paste-ready social post draft built only from the printed totals, factual register enforced (numbers and equivalences, no self-congratulation); attribution stays in the card footer, not in the draft.
- skills: fixed REPO_DIR resolution when `statusLine.command` contains a shell-escaped path (e.g. `~/Claude\ OS/...`): tilde and escaped spaces are now expanded, so /carbon-card and /carbon-update run the install actually wired into the statusline instead of falling back to `~/code/claude-carbon` or the plugin cache.

### docs: CITATION.cff and a Citing section in the README

License stays plain MIT. Citation is encouraged, not required: CITATION.cff enables GitHub's "Cite this repository" button, the README documents the short form, and the report cards keep carrying the repo + tokenclimate.com attribution in their footer (the highest-reach citation channel).

### docs: correct source framing and refresh report equivalences

An external reader's critique prompted a full audit of the public docs against primary sources. None of these changes touch the emission factors or any computed CO2 number.

- Jegham et al. is an arXiv preprint, never published in a peer-reviewed venue, and it estimates energy from public API performance data (latency, throughput) via Monte Carlo over inferred hardware configurations rather than measuring it. README and METHODOLOGY called it "a peer-reviewed study" that "measures" energy / "measured AWS telemetry". Reworded throughout, and the published critique of the paper's absolute values (Memento Humani, Nov 2025) is now cited in Limitations.
- Corroboration claims toned down: the EcoLogits band spans ~2.5x, so landing inside it is a consistency check, not "strong corroboration"; the three routes share assumptions (price proxy, parameter-count models) and do not corroborate the input factor at all (0 to ~390 Wh/Mtok across routes); Couch's figures are Opus-anchored while compared against Sonnet factors.
- The "1.3-51.8%" KV-cache amplification figure comes from Solovyeva & Castor, not From Prompts to Power; attribution fixed inline and From Prompts to Power dropped from the source list. The "single biggest lever" limitation now quantifies the swing (~0.65x-1.5x across the 0-0.20 bound) and notes output tokens dominate at the default.
- Report equivalences refreshed with current primary sources: car 120 -> 142 gCO2e/km (ADEME Impact CO2, 2025 model, lifecycle), Google search at 0.2 g (a 2009 blog figure misattributed to the 2023 environmental report) replaced by the median Gemini prompt at 0.03 g (Google, Aug 2025), TGV 2.4 -> 3.5 g/km (SNCF open data 2024, full scope), email 19 g (ADEME 2011, withdrawn; current reference ~2.5 g) removed. Applied in `/carbon-report`, `generate-report.sh` and METHODOLOGY; the old values are documented under the new table.
- README reduction percentages (-60/-70/-80) are now labeled indicative estimates, with the RTK self-reported figure and the Haiku 0.5x dependency called out.
- Consolidated uncertainty statement in Limitations: reports keep a single point estimate by design; the plausible range (~0.7x-3x) and its likely direction are documented in one place instead of ranges in the UI.
- Follow-up: the "-80% on exploration" Haiku routing claim was inconsistent with the tool's own factors (Haiku = 0.5x Sonnet = 0.25x Opus per token implies -50% vs Sonnet subagents, -75% vs Opus). The table now derives the gain from the factors and states both baselines, and warns that a Haiku-dominated total rides entirely on the widest band in the tool.

### fix: skill invocations ignored `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` / `CLAUDE_CARBON_DIR` (#15, #16)

The path sweep that taught the installer and scripts to honour `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CLAUDE_CARBON_DIR` never touched `skills/`, so the bash embedded in three SKILL.md files still pointed at the default `~/.claude` and `~/code/claude-carbon`. On a second environment (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-work`) or a custom install dir, `/carbon-card`, `/carbon-report` and `/carbon-update` read or wrote the wrong location. They now resolve paths the same way the scripts do: `carbon-report` reads the DB from `${CLAUDE_CARBON_DB:-${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/claude-carbon/carbon.db}` and points its setup hint at `${CLAUDE_CARBON_DIR:-$HOME/code/claude-carbon}`; `carbon-update` reads `settings.json` from `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}`; `carbon-card` locates the install from the status-line command (falling back to `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, then `CLAUDE_CARBON_DIR`) instead of the hardcoded default. Default behaviour is unchanged when neither variable is set.

## 2026-07-21

### feat: honour `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for second Claude environments (#15)

Claude Code can run out of an alternate config dir (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-work claude`), but every path in claude-carbon was hardcoded to `~/.claude`, so a second environment could not track itself. All state now resolves against `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}`: the settings merge and `/carbon-*` command symlinks (install.sh), the database dir (setup.sh, safety-rescan.sh), the transcript scan and inserts (backfill.sh, persist-session.sh), the re-price and report reads (recompute.sh, generate-report.sh), and the usage cache, credentials lookup and update-notice flag (statusline.sh, check-update.sh, update.sh). Install into the alternate dir by putting the var on the `bash` side of the pipe. Because the hooks and status line inherit `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` from the environment that launched `claude`, each environment writes its own DB. Default behaviour is unchanged when the var is unset. As a side effect `generate-report.sh` now also honours `CLAUDE_CARBON_DB` like the other scripts (previously it ignored it).

### fix: `CLAUDE_CARBON_DIR` install example passed the var to `curl`, not `bash` (#16)

The documented custom-directory one-liner set `CLAUDE_CARBON_DIR=... curl ... | bash`, which scopes the variable to `curl`; the piped `bash` never saw it and installed to the default location. Moved the assignment to the `bash` side of the pipe.

## 2026-07-20

### feat: `--until` for closed reporting periods

`generate-report.sh` could only report from a start date up to today, so a card for a finished period (a semester, a quarter) was impossible: the headline number always swept in the current month. `--until` takes an exclusive upper bound, and everything that implicitly meant "now" is re-anchored on it.

- SQL window gets an upper bound (`started_at < UNTIL`).
- The annual projection and the trailing-30-day trend measure to the period end instead of today. Without this, a January-June card extrapolated its run rate from July sessions.
- The label under the headline states the bound. "823 sessions depuis janvier" otherwise reads as "up to now" while the number says otherwise.
- The filename carries the window (`claude-carbon-summary-fr-2026-01-01_2026-06-30.png`), so two runs over different periods no longer overwrite each other.
- The generation date in the top-right corner is dropped on a closed period: it says nothing useful and contradicts the stated window.

Default behaviour is unchanged when `--until` is absent.

## 2026-07-19

### feat: weekly traffic snapshot (stats/)

GitHub's traffic API only keeps a 14-day rolling window, so `scripts/traffic-snapshot.sh` merges per-day views/clones into `stats/traffic.json` (latest fetch wins on overlapping days) and appends dated referrer/path snapshots as JSONL. Runs Mondays via `.github/workflows/traffic.yml` (workflow_dispatch too); needs a `TRAFFIC_TOKEN` fine-grained PAT secret with repository Administration read, because the traffic endpoints reject the default Actions token. Seeded with the current window: unique cloners ≈ real installs (install.sh and npx both end in `git clone`; updates are `git pull` and don't count).

### feat: `--segment` mode for embedding in other status lines

`statusline.sh --segment` prints only the cost + CO2 pair (`$0.68 · 35g CO₂`) and exits before the progress bar, the 5h-quota lookup (so never any network call) and the git branch call. Built for [ccstatusline](https://github.com/sirmalloc/ccstatusline) custom command widgets, which pass the same status JSON on stdin; documented in the README ("Using with ccstatusline"). Full mode output is byte-identical to before.

### docs: mid-2026 evidence sweep in METHODOLOGY.md

Literature check (July 2026): Jegham et al. still at v6, EcoLogits now a published paper but still parametric for Claude, no official Anthropic disclosure. Two documentation additions, no factor changes, golden vectors untouched:

- Cross-validation: added Couch (Jan 2026) as a third independent route (Epoch AI per-query estimate scaled by API price ratios, ~1,950 Wh/Mtok output vs ~2,880 here, within ~1.5x).
- Limitations: replaced the multi-region bullet with a fleet-mix limitation covering the tri-hardware fleet (AWS Trainium/GPU, Google TPU 1+ GW in 2026, Nvidia) and the ~300 MW gas-powered Memphis Colossus 1 lease (SpaceX S-1, May 2026). Weighted CIF effect ~+5-10%, flagged as a watch item.

### docs: demo GIF, social preview template, npm + CI badges

- `docs/demo.gif` at the top of the README: a scripted session replayed through the real `scripts/statusline.sh` (driver: `docs/demo/fake-session.sh`, recorder: `docs/demo/demo.tape` via vhs). Every frame is the actual renderer output; only the JSON snapshots are fabricated.
- `templates/social-preview.html`: 1280x640 GitHub social preview in the report-card visual style, rendered to `exports/social-preview.png` (local, exports/ is gitignored) for manual upload in Settings > General.
- README badges: npm version and CI workflow status next to the existing three.
- `.gitignore`: `promo/` (local marketing drafts stay out of the repo).

### docs: complete the GitHub community standards checklist

Added the five files the Community Standards page flagged as missing:

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Contributor Covenant 2.1, contact email for enforcement.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: project layout, `bash tests/run-vectors.sh`, the golden-vector rule for any `data/factors.json` / `data/prices.json` change, PR conventions, release manifest sync.
- `SECURITY.md`: private reporting (GitHub advisory or email), explicit scope (OAuth token, transcripts, installer/hooks execution, no unexpected network calls).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`: bug report and feature request as YAML forms (version, install method, runtime environment fields), plus a contact link routing security reports away from public issues.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: checklist mirroring CONTRIBUTING, with a dedicated section for methodology changes.

### feat: npm wrapper package (`npx claude-carbon`)

Published claude-carbon to npm as a thin wrapper so the package page and the registry-derived links (Socket.dev, ecosyste.ms, libraries.io, unpkg) exist, without changing the git-based distribution:

- `package.json` at the repo root (name `claude-carbon`, version synced with `plugin.json`, `files` limited to `bin/` - npm adds README/LICENSE itself; tarball is 4 files, ~8 kB).
- `bin/claude-carbon.js`: downloads `install.sh` from `main` and runs it through bash, propagating the installer's exit code. Flags: `--dry-run` (download only), `--version`, `--help`. `CLAUDE_CARBON_INSTALL_URL` overrides the source (pin a branch/fork, used by tests). Refuses Windows (the installer needs bash) and requires Node >= 18 (global `fetch`).
- README install section now offers `npx claude-carbon` next to the curl one-liner.
- Verified end-to-end against a local stub server (exit-code propagation included) and with `--dry-run` against the real GitHub URL; `npm pack --dry-run` checked for tarball contents.

Publishing (`npm publish`) is manual for now; a GitHub Action on tag can automate it later. Version bumps must keep `package.json` in sync with `plugin.json`/`marketplace.json`.

## 2026-07-15

### feat: contextual TokenClimate pointers in report and cards (1.1.1)

The OSS now routes "what about my team?" intent to the hosted layer at the moment it appears, without any ambient nagging or data collection:

- `/carbon-report` ends with a single footer line: `Team view (same methodology): tokenclimate.com`.
- The four `/carbon-card` PNG templates carry a small muted credit under the open-source badge (`vue équipe · tokenclimate.com` / `team view · tokenclimate.com`), so shared cards surface the link to viewers.
- Deliberately no status-line promo and no email capture: the update notice stays the only status-line extra, and lead capture remains on tokenclimate.com.
- The README "For teams" section documents both pointers explicitly, so the link in the output is an announced choice, not a surprise.
- Bumped the plugin version to **1.1.1** (`plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`).

## 2026-06-22

### feat: "update available" notice, one-command `/carbon-update`, and auto re-price on update

Existing installs had no way to know a new version shipped, and updating was a manual curl re-run that `git pull --ff-only` would break for anyone who had edited `data/factors.json` (which the README invites). Added a full update flow:

- **Notice**: a backgrounded, once-a-day version check (`scripts/check-update.sh`, run detached from the SessionStart hook) compares the local vs remote `plugin.json` version and writes a cached flag. The status line reads that flag locally (no network on the hot path) and shows a discreet `⬆ /carbon-update` when behind, with a 7-day staleness gate. Opt out via `CLAUDE_CARBON_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1`. Marketplace-cache installs are skipped (they use Claude Code's native auto-update).
- **Update**: a `/carbon-update` slash command (and a hardened `install.sh`) run `scripts/update.sh`, a dirty-safe `git pull` that stashes only the two user-editable data files and, on conflict, preserves the user's version to `*.local.bak`.
- **Recompute on update**: after a pull, history is re-priced with the new factors automatically. `recompute.sh` now defaults to **CO2-only** (idempotent, no mixed-model cost drift); cost re-pricing is opt-in via `--with-cost`. Added a 5s SQLite busy-timeout (`sqlite3 -cmd ".timeout 5000"`) so a concurrent Stop-hook write doesn't fail the recompute, and the recompute now refuses non-numeric config values (they are interpolated into SQL).
- Bumped the plugin version to **1.1.0** (`plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`) so marketplace users are offered the update.

### Refine emission factors and pricing to the best available data to date (multi-source, cross-validated)

Triangulated the per-model CO2 factors and Anthropic pricing across independent sources (Jegham et al. v6 empirical AWS measurements, EcoLogits parametric LCA, third-party inference-energy studies, AWS regional grid data), with adversarial verification of the load-bearing numbers.

- CO2 (gCO2e/Mtok, usage-only, AWS region grid 0.287): **Sonnet 39/826** - a 3-point OLS fit to Jegham v6's three measured Claude 3.7 Sonnet energies (0.950 / 2.989 / 5.671 Wh), cross-validated by EcoLogits which brackets the same range. **Opus 78/1652** (2x Sonnet): the current EcoLogits Opus 4.5+ parameter ratio and the Anthropic price ratio both imply ~1.7-2x, replacing the earlier 3x; honest band 2x-5x. **Haiku 20/413** (0.5x). **Fable 156/3304** (2x Opus). Bands and unmeasured-extrapolation caveats are documented in `METHODOLOGY.md`.
- Relabeled the 0.287 kgCO2e/kWh carbon intensity as the AWS region grid (location-based), not a "US average" (the US average is ~380); kept 0.287 as the Jegham-consistent basis.
- Pricing: all USD list prices reconfirmed current (Opus $5/$25, Sonnet $3/$15, Haiku $1/$5, Fable $10/$50; cache write 1.25x 5-min tier, read 0.1x) - no drift. Added `eur_per_usd` (ECB reference rate 2026-06-22, 0.8729) for EUR display, and documented the 2x 1-hour cache-write tier.

These remain order-of-magnitude estimates and will keep being refined as measurements improve. Updated `data/factors.json`, `data/prices.json`, script fallbacks, `METHODOLOGY.md`, `README.md` and the golden vectors. Run `scripts/recompute.sh` to re-price stored rows.

### docs: note terminal/IDE-only compatibility in README

The status line and shell hooks only run in the Claude Code terminal CLI and IDE extensions, not the web (claude.ai/code) or desktop app. Added an explicit note under the install steps so users on the app don't expect CO2 tracking there.

### feat: exclude non-Anthropic models from cost/CO2 accounting (#7)

Claude Code pointed at a local model (via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) was silently counted as Sonnet, with Sonnet datacenter factors and Anthropic API pricing. Sessions whose dominant model string does not contain `claude` (including `<synthetic>`) are now stored with raw tokens but `cost_usd = 0`, `co2_grams = 0` and a new `excluded` column set to 1, and filtered out of all reports (`/carbon-report`, `generate-report.sh`). The statusline shows 0g for those models. A user-configurable `exclude_models` pattern list in `data/factors.json` can exclude additional models by name. Schema migration is the usual idempotent `ALTER TABLE`; raw tokens are preserved so excluded rows can be re-priced by `recompute.sh` if local-model factors are ever added.

### feat: Fable 5 model family (pricing + extrapolated emission factors)

`claude-fable-5` / `claude-mythos-5` were falling into the Sonnet fallback of `resolve_family`, under-costing them by 70%. New `fable` family across all scripts (backfill, persist-session, recompute, statusline): pricing $10/$50 per Mtok (current Anthropic list price), emission factors 1000/6000 gCO2e/Mtok extrapolated from Opus by the 2x list-price ratio (no published measurement; same approach as the Opus 3x-Sonnet extrapolation, documented in METHODOLOGY.md).

### fix: LC_ALL=C in carbon-report skill awk calls (#10)

The bash script in `skills/carbon-report/SKILL.md` called awk without `LC_ALL=C`. Under comma-decimal locales (de_DE, fr_FR), awk truncated values at the decimal point (431.7045 → 431) and rendered output with commas. `export LC_ALL=C` at the top of the script covers all seven calls, mirroring the fix already applied to `scripts/*.sh`.

### fix: backfill.sh derives project name from cwd instead of directory name (#11)

`backfill.sh` took the last hyphen-separated token of the transcript directory name, which destroyed real hyphens in project names (`billing-service` → `service`) and merged distinct projects. It now reads the first `cwd` from the transcript JSONL via `jq -n 'first(inputs ...)'` (no SIGPIPE under `set -o pipefail`) and takes its basename, matching `persist-session.sh`. Previously backfilled rows keep their old names; delete and re-run backfill to normalize (noted in README).

## 2026-06-05

### fix: deduplicate tokens, correct pricing, and count cache_read energy

Three correctness fixes to token accounting in `backfill.sh` and `persist-session.sh`, validated against ccusage on the same JSONL:

- **Deduplication.** `aggregate_jsonl` now dedups assistant messages by `(message.id, requestId)` keeping the last occurrence, before summing. Resumed/compacted sessions replay prior messages within a file and streaming writes the same message repeatedly; 55% of assistant lines on observed data are replays, so the previous raw sum over-counted tokens ~3x. The duplication is entirely within-file, so per-file dedup is sufficient.
- **Pricing.** Replaced the hardcoded $15/$75 (retired Opus 4.0/4.1 rate) with current Anthropic list pricing: Opus 4.6+ $5/$25, Sonnet $3/$15, Haiku $1/$5. Cost now also counts cache_write at 1.25x input and cache_read at 0.1x input. On deduplicated data `cost_usd` reconciles to within a few percent of ccusage.
- **Cache read energy.** Cache reads (90%+ of token volume) are no longer excluded from CO2. They now count at `cache_read_factor` (default 0.08) of the input factor, an engineering estimate of the decode-phase KV re-read residual, documented in METHODOLOGY.md and `data/factors.json`. This is not the 0.1x billing ratio (a price, not energy).

Schema gains a `cache_read_tokens` column (idempotent `ALTER TABLE` migration in setup/backfill/persist; new installs get it in `CREATE TABLE`). `CLAUDE_CARBON_DB` env var added to override the DB path for testing. Existing rows keep their old values until a re-backfill; new live sessions use the corrected methodology immediately.

### feat: durable raw-token storage + recompute, surviving the 30-day JSONL purge

Make the DB self-sufficient so derived metrics survive Anthropic's ~30-day transcript purge and any future methodology change, without ever needing the JSONL again.

- **Raw tokens stored, not just derived numbers.** Added `cache_creation_tokens` and `methodology_version` columns. Rows now carry the full breakdown (regular input = `input_tokens - cache_creation_tokens`, cache write, cache read, output), so cost and CO2 become pure functions of stored tokens + config.
- **`recompute.sh`** (new). Re-derives `cost_usd` and `co2_grams` for all `methodology_version >= 2` rows from `data/factors.json` + `data/prices.json`, no JSONL. Run it after any price/factor change. Mixed-model sessions recompute at the dominant model (small approximation; the insert is per-subagent accurate). `CLAUDE_CARBON_FACTORS` / `CLAUDE_CARBON_PRICES` env overrides for testing.
- **`data/prices.json`** (new). Pricing moved out of the scripts into config (Opus $5/$25, Sonnet $3/$15, Haiku $1/$5; cache write 1.25x, cache read 0.1x). A future price change is one edit + `recompute.sh`, not a code change in three scripts.
- **`safety-rescan.sh`** (new) + `SessionStart` hook. Throttled (once/day), backgrounded `backfill.sh` re-run that catches sessions the `Stop` hook missed, while their transcript is still on disk.

Verified end-to-end on a temp DB: backfill stores the raw breakdown; recompute reproduces totals from tokens alone (~$2,667 / 230 kg, matching ccusage); changing the cache_read_factor moves CO2 only; changing a price moves cost only.

### fix: restore reset time display when stdin passes epoch

Claude Code injects `rate_limits.five_hour.resets_at` as a Unix epoch (number), while the fallback API returns ISO-8601 with fractional seconds + tz offset. The parser now branches on numeric vs string input and strips `.fraction`, `Z`, and `+HH:MM` suffixes before `date -j -u -f`. Without this, the stdin path left `END_EPOCH` empty and the `↻HH:MM` suffix silently disappeared.

### refactor: 5h quota via Anthropic OAuth API (drops ccusage heuristic)

The 5h block usage % is now pulled from `https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` (same data as `/usage` in Claude Code), with a stdin-first path reading `rate_limits.five_hour.used_percentage` when Claude Code injects it. Removes the ccusage dependency, the learned `token-limit` file, the `CLAUDE_CARBON_TOKEN_LIMIT` env seed, the async refresh lock, and the npx cold-start latency. Accurate on Max 20x without needing to saturate a block first. OAuth token resolved from macOS Keychain, env, or `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. Response cached 60s in `~/.claude/claude-carbon/oauth-usage.json`. The 🔥 burn-rate prefix and `↻HH:MM` reset time are preserved; block start is derived as `resets_at - 5h`.

## 2026-04-19

### fix: stale lock + UTC-to-local conversion for reset time

Two bugs masked the correct 5h block reset time: (1) the async-refresh lock file could survive a crashed/killed ccusage process and block every subsequent refresh indefinitely (6h of stuck data in practice), and (2) macOS `date -j -f` without `-u` parses the UTC timestamp as local time, making `↻11:00` display when the real reset was 13:00 (or 18:00 after the block rolled over). Locks older than 60s are now broken on the next run, and both `startTime`/`endTime` are parsed as UTC then formatted in local via epoch.

### feat: learned token limit file with auto-bump

The 5h quota % is now computed against a persistent ceiling stored in `~/.claude/claude-carbon/token-limit`. The file is seeded from the `CLAUDE_CARBON_TOKEN_LIMIT` env var on first run (or can be written directly), then auto-bumps whenever an observed block exceeds it. Falls back to ccusage's heuristic if neither is set. Fixes the Max 20x case where ccusage's heuristic ceiling is far too low until a block has been saturated, inflating the displayed percentage (68% shown when `/usage` reported 24%). README explains the seeding procedure via `/usage`.

## 2026-04-17

### feat: richer status line (git branch + 5h quota usage)

Status line now shows project, git branch (`⌥ branch`), model, context window %, session cost + CO2, and 5h block quota usage with reset time (`Use X% ↻HH:MM`). A 🔥 prefix appears when usage >= 15% AND burn rate >= 50%/h since block start, with a 15 min grace window to absorb bursty session starts. Quota data fetched via `ccusage` with a 30s file cache and async background refresh to avoid blocking the status line. Strips `(1M context)` / `(200K context)` from model display name. Reordered segments left-to-right: project → model state → cost → quota.

## 2026-04-09

### docs: update README install instructions

Removed plugin marketplace install (not validated by Anthropic). Added Playwright + Chromium install instructions for `/carbon-card`.

### feat: one-line installer (install.sh)

`curl | bash` installer that clones the repo, runs setup, and auto-configures `~/.claude/settings.json` (statusLine + Stop hook). Supports custom install directory via `CLAUDE_CARBON_DIR`. Idempotent: updates existing installs with `git pull`.

### feat: plugin marketplace support

Restructured as official Claude Code plugin. Installable via `/plugin install claude-carbon` or `curl | bash`. Added `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

### chore: add GitHub badges to README

Stars, license, and release badges for social proof.

## 2026-04-05

### feat: generate-report.sh + report-card.html

PNG card generator for LinkedIn sharing. Queries carbon.db for total CO2, sessions, cost, car km equivalence, top 3 projects, and most used model. Injects into a branded HTML template (violet/orange/cream, Clash Display + Owner Text) and exports retina 2x PNG via Playwright.

## 2026-04-05

### feat: statusline.sh

Reads Claude Code status JSON from stdin. Outputs formatted status line with color dot (green/yellow/red), 10-block progress bar, cost, CO2 in adaptive g/kg units, and project name.

### feat: setup.sh

Init script: checks jq/sqlite3 deps, creates ~/.claude/claude-carbon/carbon.db with sessions schema + index, runs backfill, prints CO2 summary (total + current year), and next-steps guide for settings.json.

### feat: backfill.sh

Parses all historical ~/.claude/projects/_/_.jsonl transcripts. Aggregates tokens per session, estimates cost by model family, calculates CO2 using factors.json, inserts into DB with source='backfill'. Skips non-UUID filenames, subagents/ and vercel-plugin/ dirs, and already-processed sessions.

### feat: persist-session.sh

Stop hook: reads statusline JSON from stdin, calculates CO2, INSERT OR REPLACE into carbon.db with source='live'. Completely silent on all failures (missing DB, missing session_id, jq/sqlite3 errors).

### feat: skills/carbon-report/SKILL.md

/claude-carbon:report skill. Inline bash script queries carbon.db and displays today/year/all-time totals, equivalences (car km, Google searches, TGV km), top 5 sessions by CO2, and per-project breakdown.

### feat: plugin.json + hooks.json

plugin.json declares plugin metadata, statusLine command, and skills directory. hooks.json wires persist-session.sh to the Stop hook.

### docs: README.md + METHODOLOGY.md + LICENSE

README covers install, emission factors, usage, and dependencies. METHODOLOGY documents the Jegham et al. 2025 source, formula, infrastructure parameters (PUE/CIF/WUE), per-model factors, and limitations. LICENSE is MIT 2026.
